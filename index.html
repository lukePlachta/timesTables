        in learning multiplication or getting back into it this site is the right place for you. Select the link below and you will be
        directed to the times tables page. Select each click me button to view that particular times table. But before doing so make sure
        you have tried your best without looking at the answer.</p>
        <p class="introText">This site has been created using Mark up languages such as HTML, CSS and also JavaScript a programming language. The times tables
        have been created using a for loop and has been programmed to stop after each number as been multiplied by 12. It has been linked with
        the HTML and the CSS so that it appears where it appears and the look of it as well.</p>
        <p class="introText">As this site was created with a Windows 10 Laptop in the resolution of 1920 by 1080, Media Queries have been implemented so that the
